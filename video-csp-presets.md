# Video and CSP Presets
?> **NOTICE** Save your current settings as presets in Content Manager for Video and Custom Shaders Patch !

## 4.1 Video Presets
These are some video presets I made if you don't want to read through the settings below, try each one out and see what works best. Also adjust to your needs.  
Make sure to double check the <ins>Rendering Mode</ins> so that its set correctly for your headset !  

- High Performance: [Link here](https://acstuff.club/s/lW4B) (Disable post processing if you need even more performance)  
- Balanced: [Link here](https://acstuff.club/s/oFw)
- High Quality: [Link here](https://acstuff.club/s/hPvJ) (For best graphics find a good pp filter)

?> You don't need to use frame limiters in VR since the framerate will be capped to the headsets refresh rate anyway. Using fps limiters can potentially cause performance issues.

## 4.2 CSP Setting Presets
These presets are simply to be used as a base for your own preference. Test the presets out and adjust as needed.  

- High Performance - [Link here](https://acstuff.club/s/Ozx3) (This preset has a lot of modules disabled for a little extra performance)  
- Balanced - [Link here](https://acstuff.club/s/PaP3)  
- High Quality - [Link here](https://acstuff.club/s/J0Je)
