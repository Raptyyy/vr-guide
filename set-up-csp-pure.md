# Custom Shaders Patch (CSP) and Pure  

## Setting up Custom Shaders Patch (CSP)
1. In Content Manager go to <ins>Settings > Custom Shader Patch</ins>  
   1.1 If you are prompted to install Custom Shaders Patch, press install  
2. Go to <ins>Settings > Custom Shader Patch > About & Updates</ins> and verify that you are on the latest version which should be at the top of the list on the right side.  

If you are using a preview version of CSP from Patreon then install it manually or through the quick install link in the Patreon post  

## Setting up Pure
Pure is recommended for VR as it delivers a more realistic and consistent image, also has a lot of adjustability and various post processing to change the look of the game.  
1. Make sure you are on the latest version of CSP
2. Go to Peter Boese Patreon page and download Pure from there, it costs $1 - [Pure Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/c/peterboese/posts)
3. There is an installation guide in the Pure post, follow it thoroughly. [Link to the guide here too](https://youtu.be/KJE2xac5f8s?si=wG83vjPtUeWVK-5q&t=222)

!> **IMPORTANT** Do not install Pure using Content Manager, incorrect installation of Pure can cause major performance issues !

Pure, PureVR - these come with Pure  
[Natural Mod PP Filter](https://www.overtake.gg/downloads/natural-mod-pp-filter.4551/) - Natural looking filter with good performance  
[Improved Visuals PureCS Filter](https://www.overtake.gg/downloads/improved-visuals-pure-cs-filter-screen-and-vr-ppfilter.54256/) - VR focused pp filter with great adjustability
