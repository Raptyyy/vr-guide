# VR guide for Assetto Corsa and CSP

The purpose of this guide is to help with basic VR setup, installing Custom Shaders Patch, Pure and adjusting your settings for the best experience.  
It also covers usage of OpenComposite and the OpenXR Toolkit.  
This guide is written with Content Manager and Custom Shaders Patch in mind, not intended to work with vanilla Assetto Corsa.  
If you have anything useful to add to the guide or see a mistake, feel free to make an issue and I will correct it.  

> [!TIP]
> Most people should only have to read the first 6 chapters (Up to video settings), beyond that is more in depth coverage of various settings.

> [!NOTE]
> For further help or if you want to report a game issue, join the Custom Shaders Patch discord and use the `virtual-reality-talk` channel
