# VR guide for Assetto Corsa and CSP

This guide covers basic VR setup, installing Custom Shaders Patch, Pure and adjusting your settings for the best experience.  
It also covers usage of OpenComposite and the OpenXR Toolkit.  
This guide is written with Content Manager and Custom Shaders Patch in mind, not intended to work with vanilla Assetto Corsa.  


?> Most should only have to read the first 5 chapters (Up to video settings), beyond that is more in depth coverage of various settings, although I do recommend checking Additional Notes too.

?> For further help or if you want to report a game issue, join the Custom Shaders Patch discord and use the `virtual-reality-talk` channel.
